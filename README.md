# HexVoxel
Unity Project of a Low-Poly-esque Terrain Sandbox Simulation

I'm not yet sure how to legally declare this is mine so don't be a jerk and just fork it if you want it so I know where my work has gone. 
Since this is avaliable on Github it is free to use and fiddle with I just ask that if you feel any serious interest in doing something 
with it that you again let me know. Feel free to contact my Github account with any questions, comments, concerns, and/or date requests.

This project is a non-convential Sandbox simulator that is suppose to mimic Minecraft in gameplay and the Low-Poly art style in aesthetic.
It represents the threshold values of a 3D Perlin Noise function by points and then connects them using some basic neighbor rules.
These details will be shortly outlined and explained to the best of my ability in the Wiki that appears on this Github repository.
